                <h3>Switching to Linux</h3>
				<p> Do you know how great it is to run a Linux Kernel based operating system? I run some form of it on every PC I own. I wouldn’t have it any other way. My geriatric Dell laptop was the first. I was having a whole host of issues with it. It’s an Inspiron from the Vista days and it just could not handle running Windows any longer.  I had already tried migrating to Windows 7 to no avail. I’d heard of Linux and I had a friend who suggested it often. I toyed around with idea plenty of times prior to the switch but one day I couldn’t boot. Windows was damaged, again, and I needed to try something new. I acted boldly out of desperation and chose Ubuntu 16.04 due to my friends suggestion and the fact that I found helpful information about it more readily.</p>
                <h5>Step 1: Picking a Distribution</h5>
				<p><img class="ft" src="geriatric.jpg" alt="Pic of a disassembled machine" title="My laptop. Taken apart. In pieces." height="170px">My choice was already made. I wasn’t dumb with computers but my real interest in them hadn’t peaked yet. My good buddy had suggested Elementary OS but, after reading about it, I wanted something that had more software options. I looked into its mother OS, Ubuntu, and I was decided.</p>
                <h5>Step 2: The, Soon to be Familiar, Process</h5>
                <p>Pick an iso image for download and flash a zip drive with the image. I used UNetbootin per some suggestions I found on <a href="https://askubuntu.com" style="color:black;">AskUbuntu.com.</a> This site was the first stop to how I solved any problem I had for the next week. Followed by calling my aforementioned buddy and blaming him for some “Linux Failing.” Interestingly enough, none of the problems I ran into were based in Linux, but were actually  just bad habits I had acquired over the years while running Windows.  For example, I was sorely disappointed, I couldn’t download programs in the Windows fashion. I guess I really wanted to find something in the wild of the net and click <input type="button" value="next"> two hundred times until it ran. I later realized it was actually less work, and safer, to acquire software the “Linux Way.”</p>

               <div style="background:black;color:green;max-width:50%;margin:auto;font-size:20px;"><p><code><strong>root@pc ~ $</strong>sudo apt install program</code></p></div>
               
                <h5>Step 3: Love at First. . . Live Preview</h5>
				<p>What initially sold me on Ubuntu, and Linux in general, was that I could try it before I installed it. Not to mention that it was actually booting up. Kind of a big deal, right? Followed by not having my machine hijacked during the actual installation. That’s super weird. . . Then the restart. Wouldn’t you know it that my Dell rebooted in under 30 seconds. Old hdd, old everything else, formally taking more than 5 minutes from pressing the power button to launching Chrome had booted during the first boot up in under 30 seconds. It never lagged, or froze, or stuttered until I goofed it all up myself but that’s more of a personality trait than a Linux problem. I just like to dig into things and play with how they work. Some times a few things break. <br><strong>End</strong>
                <p>The next computer that I installed Linux on was a server I built. After a few months getting acquainted with Linux and learning how to tweak it I put together a Frankenstein-ish machine as a server. Once again I went with Ubuntu 16.04. This time the server iso. This, with a few automation oriented applications, was an amazing evolution for my Plex server. Taking my home media, and now anywhere, experience to new heights. </p>
                <p>Finally there was a computer I had planned on building for months. Meticulously going through part lists and vendors. Comparing price, performance, and everything I could think of until, money saved and mind made up, I pulled the trigger. Even after all this I still had it in my mind that I would eventually get Windows running on the machine.  I built my new machine and named it Gargantuan-Machina. I installed Solus 3 on it and I’ve loved every minute of use I’ve had since. I currently have no plans to ever run Windows on it. </p>
                <p>That, briefly, is the story of my switch. I’d love to hear about yours.  There are many similar stories about people and their first experiences with Linux. There a great many differences too. I’d love to hear from you about your transition from proprietary software.

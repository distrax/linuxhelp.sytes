A number of things jump out to me when I began typing this post. First that
I've rarely, for a length of time, used any distro that wasn't a debian
derivative and Solus is the only exception of that. Solus is so intuitive it
feels like it just works without having to learn much. I really need to
explore some more of the Linux world.
	I've got several different virtual drives with variations of many
distributions. Fedora, Korora, Antergos, Arch, MX-17, Debian Stretch, etc...
While I've installed most of these on my machines none have really stuck
around. Until Solus. Solus is a work of art by a phenomenal team of people. I
digress. I also realized that I hadn't used xfce at all. Only KDE and Gnome.
So I thought to find a new distro for my laptop. 
	I found myself stuck in between two distros. MX Linux because, despite
it not fitting my criteria, it had such great reviews and looked so usable.
Manjaro was the other. I have enjoyed the little time I've spent on Manjaro
but never under xfce and never very long. I always ran into too many small
issues that built up until I couldn't run it or trust it. I'm hoping that
might be better under the flagship environment. So due to MX not actually
fitting my criteria I went with Manjaro. Being an arch based distribution I
had to learn to use it unlike a Debian based one. 
	First task was setting up all the programs I needed for my day to day.
	Upon further thought I may need to change again. I'm having an issue
	accessing my Samba server from my manjaro machine. to be continued...
